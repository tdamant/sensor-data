# SensorApp

##Approach

This is the first angular app I have built so I prioritised simplicity in design.
I have also assumed a fixed schema for the JSON data. The app could be made to be more flexible
and deal with a different range of sensor data however again for the task at hand I prioritised simplicity.

##Improvements
As mentioned the stylings are simple - in particular transitions would improve the UI.
Adding tests for some of the functions which manipulate data would also improve the app.

##Running
``npm i``
``ng serve``
